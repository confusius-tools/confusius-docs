# # Searchlight decoding of a continuous variable
#
# This example maps which parts of a fUSI recording carry information about how fast a
# rat is moving with a searchlight: a small cross-validated model run over the local
# neighborhood of every voxel. Unlike a GLM, which asks voxel by voxel whether one
# voxel's signal tracks the regressor, the searchlight asks whether the local pattern
# around each voxel can predict it, picking up information carried jointly by neighboring
# voxels rather than by any one alone.
#
# We follow the experimental setting and dataset of [Cybis Pereira et al.
# 2026](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116791), decoding locomotion speed from a
# single sagittal plane, and compare the searchlight map against a GLM fit on the same
# data. Both analyses receive the same preprocessing steps, so the only thing that
# differs between them is univariate versus multivariate, which is the comparison we
# actually want to make.

# ## Correct for motion
#
# The rat moves freely, so a real analysis should first correct volume-to-volume brain
# motion. We skip it here to keep the example fast to build, at the cost of a little
# statistical robustness in the maps below.
#
# !!! note "Recommended in a real analysis"
#     Register every volume to a reference frame with
#     [`register_volumewise`][confusius.registration.register_volumewise] before
#     building the regressors, then continue with the corrected `data`. Removing
#     motion-driven variance sharpens the speed maps and their statistics. See the
#     [Motion correction of a single
#     recording](../registration/volumewise_motion_correction.md) example for the full
#     workflow and diagnostics.
#
#     ```python
#     data = cf.registration.register_volumewise(data, learning_rate=1)

#
# ## Build the speed regressor
#
# The animal is tracked with DeepLabCut at 50 frames per second. We take the
# frame-to-frame displacement of the body marker, smooth it with a one second centered
# rolling mean, and resample it onto the fUSI volume acquisition times.

# ## What the searchlight should actually predict
#
# The speed signal above is an instantaneous behavioral variable, and the power Doppler
# signal contains a proxy of the neural signal encoding the speed signal through the
# neurovascular coupling. With the neurovascular coupling inherent delay, asking a
# decoder to predict the instantaneous trace from that signal sets it an impossible
# target. We therefore decode an *hemodynamically convolved* speed regressor.
#
# We build it with the modified Claron 2021 HRF, a rodent fUSI response function, and
# read it straight off a first-level design matrix. Building the design matrix here
# serves double duty: its `speed` column is the searchlight target, and the whole matrix
# is what we hand the GLM later, so the two analyses are guaranteed to see the same
# regressor.

# ## Preprocess the data exactly as the GLM does
#
# The point of this example is to compare a univariate analysis with a multivariate one,
# which only works if everything *else* is held equal. So the decoder gets the same
# preprocessing the GLM applies.
#
# **Spatial smoothing.** `FirstLevelModel(smoothing_fwhm=0.3)` smooths each run with
# [`smooth_volume`][confusius.spatial.smooth_volume] before fitting. We apply the same
# call with the same value, rather than leaving the searchlight to work on unsmoothed
# data while the GLM enjoys the noise reduction.
#
# **Drift and confound removal.** Power Doppler carries slow drift and nuisance signal
# that have nothing to do with locomotion. The GLM handles them with cosine drift and
# [CompCor][confusius.signal.compute_compcor_confounds] regressors in its design; a
# decoder has no design matrix, so we remove the same regressors from the data up front
# with [`clean`][confusius.signal.clean], reusing the design matrix's own nuisance
# columns.
#
# The target is cleaned with the same regressors as the data, so both sides have the
# same nuisance structure removed. This mirrors what the GLM does implicitly when it
# fits the speed regressor and the nuisance regressors jointly.

# ## Run the searchlight
#
# Running searchlight through the entire field of view is costly because this means
# fitting a few tens of thousands of models. Here we will create a mask to only run the
# searchlight algorithm in the top half of the field of view. A real region-of-interest
# mask, such as an intensity-thresholded brain mask, or an anatomical brain region mask,
# would be of good use here just the same.
#
# Two details matter for fUSI data:
#
# - `radius` is in the units of the data's spatial coordinates, not in voxel indices.
#   Each neighborhood is the set of voxels within `radius` millimeters of the center.
# - Consecutive fUSI volumes are strongly autocorrelated. Cross-validating with shuffled
#   folds would put near-duplicate volumes in both the training and test sets and
#   inflate the scores. `SearchLight` therefore builds contiguous temporal folds by
#   default. Each fold also needs to be long enough to contain both quiet and active
#   periods, since the animal moves in bursts, which is why we keep the fold count low.
#
# The estimator is a [`RidgeCV`][sklearn.linear_model.RidgeCV]: ridge regression that
# selects its own penalty from a grid. Neighboring fUSI voxels are highly correlated,
# and the right amount of regularization varies across the plane. By default `RidgeCV`
# picks the penalty by leave-one-out generalized cross-validation, which does put
# temporally adjacent volumes in its train and test sets, unlike the contiguous folds we
# use for the outer searchlight cross-validation. That is not a problem: the penalty
# search runs entirely inside each outer training fold and never sees the outer test
# fold, so it only affects which penalty is chosen.
