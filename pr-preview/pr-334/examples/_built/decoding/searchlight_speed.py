# # Searchlight decoding of a continuous variable
#
# This example maps which parts of a fUSI recording carry information about how fast a
# rat is moving with a searchlight: a small cross-validated model run over the local
# neighborhood of every voxel. Unlike a GLM, which asks voxel by voxel whether one
# voxel's signal tracks the regressor, the searchlight asks whether the local pattern
# around each voxel can predict it, picking up information carried jointly by neighboring
# voxels rather than by any one alone.
#
# We follow the experimental setting and dataset of [Cybis Pereira et al.
# 2026](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2025.116791), decoding locomotion speed from a
# single sagittal plane, and compare the searchlight map against a GLM fit on the same
# data. Both analyses receive the same preprocessing steps, so the only thing that
# differs between them is univariate versus multivariate, which is the comparison we
# actually want to make.

# ## What the searchlight should actually predict
#
# The speed signal above is an instantaneous behavioral variable, and the power Doppler
# signal contains a proxy of the neural signal encoding the speed signal through the
# neurovascular coupling. With the neurovascular coupling inherent delay, asking a
# decoder to predict the instantaneous trace from that signal sets it an impossible
# target. We therefore decode an *hemodynamically convolved* speed regressor.
#
# We build it with the modified Claron 2021 HRF, a rodent fUSI response function, and
# read it straight off a first-level design matrix. Building the design matrix here
# serves double duty: its `speed` column is the searchlight target, and the whole matrix
# is what we hand the GLM later, so the two analyses are guaranteed to see the same
# regressor.

# ## Preprocess the data exactly as the GLM does
#
# The point of this example is to compare a univariate analysis with a multivariate one,
# which only works if everything *else* is held equal. So the decoder gets the same
# preprocessing the GLM applies.
#
# **Spatial smoothing.** `FirstLevelModel(smoothing_fwhm=0.3)` smooths each run with
# [`smooth_volume`][confusius.spatial.smooth_volume] before fitting. We apply the same
# call with the same value, rather than leaving the searchlight to work on unsmoothed
# data while the GLM enjoys the noise reduction.
#
# **Drift and confound removal.** Power Doppler carries slow drift and nuisance signal
# that have nothing to do with locomotion. The GLM handles them with cosine drift and
# [CompCor][confusius.signal.compute_compcor_confounds] regressors in its design; a
# decoder has no design matrix, so we remove the same regressors from the data up front
# with [`clean`][confusius.signal.clean], reusing the design matrix's own nuisance
# columns.
#
# The target is cleaned with the same regressors as the data, so both sides have the
# same nuisance structure removed. This mirrors what the GLM does implicitly when it
# fits the speed regressor and the nuisance regressors jointly.

# ## Run the searchlight
#
# Z-scoring during cleaning sets any zero-variance voxel, such as the corners outside the
# imaged plane, to NaN, and a neighborhood that includes one cannot be fit. We therefore
# pass a `mask` selecting the voxels that stayed finite through preprocessing; without it
# `SearchLight` would try to use every voxel and refuse to run. A real region-of-interest
# mask, such as an intensity-thresholded brain mask, would go here just the same.
#
# Two details matter for fUSI data:
#
# - `radius` is in the units of the data's spatial coordinates, not in voxel indices.
#   fUSI voxels are usually anisotropic, so an index-based radius would silently give
#   anisotropic neighborhoods. Each neighborhood is the set of voxels within `radius`
#   millimeters of the center.
# - Consecutive fUSI volumes are strongly autocorrelated, and the HRF convolution makes
#   the target smoother still. Cross-validating with shuffled folds would put
#   near-duplicate volumes in both the training and test sets and inflate the scores.
#   `SearchLight` therefore builds contiguous temporal folds by default. Each fold also
#   needs to be long enough to contain both quiet and active periods, since the animal
#   moves in bursts, which is why we keep the fold count low.
#
# The estimator is a `RidgeCV`: ridge regression that selects its own penalty from a
# grid. Neighboring fUSI voxels are highly correlated, and the right amount of
# regularization varies across the plane, so fixing a single penalty by hand would favor
# some regions arbitrarily. By default `RidgeCV` picks the penalty by leave-one-out
# generalized cross-validation, which does put temporally adjacent volumes in its train
# and test sets, unlike the contiguous folds we use for the outer searchlight
# cross-validation. That is not a problem: the penalty search runs entirely inside each
# outer training fold and never sees the outer test fold, so it only affects which
# penalty is chosen.

# The overlap is partial: the two maps answer related but different questions. The GLM is univariate and asks, at
# each voxel, whether that voxel's signal tracks the speed regressor. The searchlight is
# multivariate and cross-validated, and asks whether the local pattern around each voxel
# predicts the regressor in held-out blocks of time. Matching the preprocessing and the
# regressor removes the reasons the two maps could differ artifactually, leaving the
# genuine difference between a univariate and a multivariate question.
