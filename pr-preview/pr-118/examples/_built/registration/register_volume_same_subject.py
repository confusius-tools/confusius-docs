# # Registration of two sessions from the same subject
#
# This example shows how to align two power Doppler images acquired from the same
# subject in different sessions. We use
# [`register_volume`][confusius.registration.register_volume] with a rigid transform,
# which is appropriate when the imaged anatomy is the same but the probe placement
# differs slightly between the two recordings.
#
# We pick two `angio` acquisitions from the Cybis Pereira 2026 dataset using
# [`fetch_cybis_pereira_2026`][confusius.datasets.fetch_cybis_pereira_2026]: subject
# `rat75`, slice `slice32`, recorded on consecutive days (sessions `20220523` and
# `20220524`).

# %% [markdown]
# ## Fetch and load both recordings
#
# Each recording is a single power Doppler image of one slice. We convert it to decibels
# for both display and registration, which is usually more stable on the log-compressed
# dynamic range.

# ## Inspect the misalignment before registration
#
# The two images share anatomy but live on slightly different grids because the probe
# was re-positioned between sessions. We visualise the alignment with
# [`plot_composite`][confusius.plotting.plot_composite], which resamples `moving` onto
# `fixed`'s grid and draws the two as a red/cyan composite: matched anatomy appear in
# white, while any residual red/cyan fringe reveals the displacement that
# [`register_volume`][confusius.registration.register_volume] will correct.
#
# One subtlety: the two `angio` recordings sit at slightly different `z`
# coordinates in physical space, so resampling `moving` onto `fixed`'s grid would
# place every voxel outside the fixed slab and return an empty image. We force
# `moving.z` to match `fixed.z` before plotting so the overlay actually has
# something to show. The remaining in-plane misalignment is what we're after.

# %%
moving.coords["z"] = fixed.z
cf.plotting.plot_composite(fixed, moving, bg_color=bg_color)

# %% [markdown]
# ## Run the registration
#
# A rigid transform captures the rotation and translation difference between the two
# sessions. [`register_volume`][confusius.registration.register_volume] returns three
# values:
#
# 1. the moving image (only aligned to the fixed grid if `resample=True` is used);
# 2. the rigid transform matrix that maps fixed-physical coordinates to moving-physical
#    coordinates;
# 3. a [`RegistrationDiagnostics`][confusius.registration.RegistrationDiagnostics]
#    dataclass holding the per-iteration metric values and the optimizer stop
#    condition, which we use below to plot the convergence curve.

# !!! tip "Watch registration progress live"
#     Pass `show_progress=True` to
#     [`register_volume`][confusius.registration.register_volume] to follow the
#     optimization in real time. A live matplotlib window opens during the call and
#     updates at every iteration with both the similarity-metric curve and a
#     fixed/moving composite overlay. It is the fastest way to tell whether the
#     optimizer is making progress, stuck in a local minimum, or diverging—and to
#     decide which arguments to tweak from the warning above.
#
# !!! warning "Registration is sensitive to its arguments"
#     The result depends heavily on the choice of `transform_type`, `metric`,
#     `learning_rate`, `number_of_iterations`, `convergence_window_size`,
#     `centering_initialization`, and the multi-resolution settings
#     (`use_multi_resolution`, `shrink_factors`, `smoothing_sigmas`). The values used in
#     this example were empirically found to work well in this case, but you should
#     definitely try different arguments (start with the default!) if the result is not
#     satisfactory—inspect the
#     [`RegistrationDiagnostics`][confusius.registration.RegistrationDiagnostics]
#     convergence curve and the post-registration overlay, and sweep these arguments
#     until you get a stable, well-converged result.
